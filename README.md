# Pallium CMS
> In neuroscience, pallium refers to layers of gray and white matter that cover the upper surface of the brain's cerebrum.

Pallium CMS is a node.js content management application built to create and edit Markdown files with YAML front matter through a simple user interface. Ultimately, the result of this CMS may be used by your static site generator of choice. 


## Why Use Pallium CMS?
Many popular static site generators have been built to consume markdown files with YAML front matter. The problem is that when you're editing your website, these tools assume that you know a lot. You need to know how to write using Markdown, the expected structure of the files, as well as what should go in the front matter for each file. 

Pallium CMS provides you with a front-end for the administration of a static website. This makes it a great choice when you want to allow non-technical people access to edit content for your site.
