title: Markdown

This displays a markdown editor field using [catdown](https://github.com/zuren/catdown).

**Note**: In order to have a content section in a front-matter Markdown file, the field name should be `__content`.

- *full*: If set to _true_, the markdown editor will display on the full width of the page. Otherwise, the editor will show a side-by-side view.
